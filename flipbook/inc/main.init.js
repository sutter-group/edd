By earning the trust of several large institu- tions with very high aesthetic standards and secured spaces, we are regularly asked to work with their art, exhibit, and other custom projects. Frequently these projects require cooperation with the Smith- sonian Institution, corporate and private art collections. Space planning and custom fabrication design are part of near- ly every project. Most projects include the management of the fabrication by others and, on occasion, we have physically built smaller projects ourselves.

        "5": "Two of the world\u2019s largest international financial organizations commissioned EDD to design and build an exhibition to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of their organizations at the Bretton Woods Conference in New Hamp- shire. Duplicate exhibits were placed in the lobbies of the two organizations\u2019 headquarters buildings. EDD designed and fabricated nine 9-foot tall by 4-foot wide freestanding panels made from alu- minum, for each of the two buildings. Each panel was equipped with a slot for graphic \u201ccontent\u201c board, two lights, and a brochure holder on the side. Two of the display panels contained audio and visual equipment which played recordings of archived interviews with those involved in the Bretton Woods Conference. The exhibits were on display for several months. Project Challenges The true challenge for both of the exhibits was their location. Each exhibit was at the center of their 12-story atrium of the HQ buildings in DC. The grand scale of these locations called for sub- stantial size of the exhibit elements matching the scale and style of the architecture. To amplify this challenge neither IMF, nor the World Bank, would allow for extended installation in the middle of the busy and prominent public place. Both exhibits had to \u201cappear\u201d instantly at both locations and \u201cdisappear\u201d in the same fashion at the end. The solution to this was the use of honeycombed aluminum panels with hinged elements making it portable and collapsible. We shop fabricated two identical sets and popped them up like origami at the scheduled day. \f",

        "7": "Researchers at the Janelia Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) use nuclear microscopes to study the brains of fruit flies. These images are amazing compositions of color and form. Dr. Rubin, an aesthetic guardian of the Janelia campus, wanted to create a permanent exhibit to prominently display the work of the researchers. He selected a number of these images to be displayed initially and his concept called for the ability to update the images as they become available. Most of the chosen photographs were to be enlarged to 8\u2019x8\u2019 and flush mounted on the corridor walls surrounding the Conference Center. These walls, as with most of the buildings main circulation, are built in a slight and varying curve. Placing 8 ft wide flat art on curved walls became the biggest challenge of the project. Scope of Work: Design removable magnetic mounting Produce technical drawings for the fabricator Design existing wall structural support Assist with selection of images to verify suitable resolution Layout design for 26 pieces on 12 walls Supervise wall construction Supervise installation Project Challenges: - image surface to be flush with the face of the wall - Removability to allow periodical replacement - Walls are curved, images are flat \f",

The 16 foot high figure of the climber was mounted on the a curved wall with a square niche. The sculpture was fabricated using 4 sizes of powder-coated aluminium tubing connected with 96 custom joints to 40 wooden spheres turned from 6 different exotic wood species. To meet the requirement to make the piece removable, custom joints were designed and machined to connect the elements. The artist, working out of her Paris studio, sent us a 30 inch high ma- quette. We converted it to a digital 3-D model along with the curved wall and the niche. Technical drawings and communication with the artist was conducted using the metric system but with local subcon- tractors we used imperial measurements. Special attention had to be given to the design and production se- quencing of the multiple joints \u201choused\u201d by each sphere. A 5-axis CNC mill was programmed with our angle data to drill joint openings. Due to the weight of the piece, the sub-structure of the niche had to be reinforced and refinished. Technological challenges of wood specie variations, diameters of spheres and complexities of angular relationships during the design were matched by challenge of sequencing the installation of the piece.

        "13": "The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) was using double-sided, mov- able, 8\u2019 long boards to exhibit the work of visiting scientists during many hosted conferences at their Janelia Farm facility. These boards provided great flex- ibility as they could be \u201crolled away\u201c after each conference. In addition, the organizers could \u201croll out\u201d any number of these required for specific volume of exhibitors. There was a problem though; participants complained that the area, a predominately naturally lit 3-story atrium, was poorly lit for exhibiting. HHMI asked EDD to provide a solution. After a quick study of the loca- tion and ceiling height we came to the conclusion that modifications to the building lighting system would compromise the flexibility of the space. The price of additional light fixtures and wiring was magnified by additional HVAC to provide cooling for the heat created by new lights. This prompted us to think out of the box. We created a prototype of a battery operated fixture to be mounted on top of the movable board and presented it to the client. We were granted a few thousand dollars to test suitable batteries and LED lights available on the market and after presenting test results we were awarded a contract to finalize the design and fabricate an initial series of 24 of these rechargeable units. Each one was equipped with four pivoting luminaries (to facilitate storage), a battery gauge, charger port and a switch. Since that orig- inal order we have fabricated 60 more of these sets for other locations of HHMI. \f",

The Artistry of African Currency - (Cooperation between IMF, Smithsonian Numismatic Collection and Dr. Henry private collection) EDD successfully merged a Smithsonian SITES Exhibit with objects from a private collector to create a unique year-long exhibition for the IMF Center. EDD\u2019s design concept featured custom integration of the objects into an existing permanent exhibit space. EDD worked closely with the Smithsonian, the private collector\u2019s curator and graphic designers in order to develop a story and an environ- ment which would meet the client\u2019s educational goal. Money and Sovereignty (Cooperation between IMF and Smithsonian) In collaboration with the Smithsonian\u2019s Numismatic Scholars, EDD developed an exhibition designed to support the goals of IMF for this two-year showcase. EDD developed custom display cases and oversaw the production and design of custom graphics and text. Additionally, EDD\u2019s team researched and identified many of the objects included in the display. One World Photo Exhibit Our team designed, fabricated, and installed the exhibit. Photo content was provided by graphic designer Massoud Etemadi. In an effort to keep costs low and to minimize waste, EDD reused some panels from a previous exhibit. The reused panels were strategically arranged with new graphics and suspended on cables from ceiling to floor, creating a fresh and engaging show tailored to the space it was housed in.

After solutions proposed by a renown global architect were rejected, EDD was given an opportunity to give it fresh thought. The EDD team presented a few ideas in 3-D sketches and a solution was agreed upon. The idea was then developed and a prototype was cre- ated and installed on site. The solution allowed for modifications to the existing balustrade without disturbing the current assembly minimizing costs and disruption to the facility operations. The 1.5 million dollar installation of stainless steel and glass balustrade exten- sions for 10 bridges and balconies will be completed in April 2017. Locomotive Lounge.
